- **Additional Functionalities**:
  - **Clear (AC)**: Reset the input.
  - **Sign Toggle (âˆ“)**: Change the sign of the current number.
  - **Percentage (%)**: Compute the percentage value.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](python.org).
3. Install the required libraries (if any).

## How It Works

- **Design :** The GUI is created using `tkinter`. It includes a grid of buttons for digits, operators, and functions.
- **Logic :** User input is managed using event listeners attached to buttons. Calculations are processed using Python's `eval` function with safeguards for invalid inputs.

## Customization

- **Themes :** Modify button colors and fonts in the `InputForm` class.
- **Icon :** Replace `ICON.ico` with your desired icon file.
- **Window Size**: Adjust dimensions in the `self.geometry` line in the `Application` class.
